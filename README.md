This Repository is connected to Overleaf at https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrxqhjvpttfb#fed0f9 - if you want to be able to share that project create an issue.

The Document is intended to give an overview of the the current state of Metadata definition and practices for astronomical data with a particular focus on the needs of the SKA Regional Centres.
