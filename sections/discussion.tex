\section{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{sec:discussion}

If a DB/DM system could incorporate IVOA language and metadata into the nascent DB for SRCNet/SKAO/SKA Pathfinders in such a way that a View could be generated for use by IVOA tools, IVOA could hypothetically be used alongside any other non-IVOA metadata that SRCNet needs.  Regardless, all SRCNet would need to agree on the same DB structure/nomenclature/identifiers, and there could be scope in the future for any non-IVOA components to be adopted into the IVOA to strengthen interoperability with other future projects such as the ngVLA.

However, one issue with conversion to different models is information loss. 
If there is no analogous component defined within the model with which the data is to be converted, then that information is necessarily excluded from the converted dataset.
