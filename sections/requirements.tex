\subsection{Demonstrator Cases of the SKA - proposal}

A proposal document (add link when/if available) for the SKA outlined 8 initial demonstrator cases (DCs) for the SKA. 
These DCs each describe the scientists intended approach to process data from the SKA in order to complete their scientific goals. 
Within the document, the scientific outline, community involvement, objectives, timelines and requirements are described for each DC.
The requirements imposed by all DCs on the computational infrastructure have been collated and presented within Table \ref{tab:DC_req}. 

\newcommand{\man}[1][]{\(\CIRCLE_{#1}\)}     % mandatory
\newcommand{\opt}[1][]{\(\LEFTcircle_{#1}\)} % optional
\newcommand{\non}{\Circle}                   % not needed

Of these stated requirements, those contained within the category of Data Access will have implications for the metadata landscape.
Downloading external archives is often cross referencing the same objects observed by the SKA with other instruments/ at different wavelengths, requiring metadata on the data source (such as position, etc.) that are compatible with that from other instruments.
Downloading and storing data also 

\subsubsection{Data Source Metadata}

Data source metadata here refers to metadata surrounding the SDPs, received by the scientists. 

% UC\_SRC\_1, UC\_SRC\_2, UC\_SRC\_4, UC\_SRC\_5, UC\_SRC\_6, UC\_SRC\_7, UC\_SRC\_9, UC\_SRC\_10, UC\_SRC\_11, UC\_SRC\_14, DC\_1, DC\_3, DC\_4 DC\_4, DC\_5, DC\_6, DC\_7, DC\_8.
% list is clunky, remove when full set of UCs are available and turn into table.
% is it necessary to add examples of how these information will be used?
