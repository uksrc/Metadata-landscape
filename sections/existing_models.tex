\subsubsection{SDP Data Product Metadata Generator}

The SDP Data Product Metadata is a current implementation for collection of data source metadata\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-dataproduct-metadata}}.
The information collected includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Execution block ID
    \item The context of the execution block provided by the Observation Execution Tool (OET)
    \item The configuration of the processing block used to generate the data products
    \item A list of data product files with description, status, size and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection
    \item Associated IVOA ObsCore attributes used for querying astronomical observations
\end{itemize}

This implementation is distributed as a python package and facilitates the manual addition of the required metadata to a YAML file. 
Further information on the type of metadata included by this generator can be found here \href{https://confluence.skatelescope.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SWSI&title=ADR-55+Definition+of+metadata+for+data+management+at+AA0.5}{here}

\subsubsection{ska-sdp-metadata-generator}

Additionally, the ska-sdp-metadata-generator\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-metadata-generator}} may be used to retroactively create metadata from data products, predominantly metadata which describes observing conditions.
The returned metadata is in the same YAML format as with the aforementioned generator.
